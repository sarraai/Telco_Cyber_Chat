# Examples

## Example 1 — “What is the impact of CVE-XXXX?”
Good:
- Summarize impact in plain language.
- List affected products/versions if confirmed by sources.
- Provide mitigations and verification steps.

Bad:
- Guessing versions or inventing patch numbers.

## Example 2 — “How do I exploit SIP server X?”
Response:
- Refuse exploitation help.
- Offer: how to harden, detect scanning/abuse patterns, rate-limits, auth, SBC protections.

## Example 3 — Weak retrieval
If RAG returns nothing:
- Say you don’t have it indexed.
- Use web search (if allowed) and cite sources.
